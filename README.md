# RG105-labyrinth-escape


Labyrinth escape is a very simple game, just find the way out.

Controls are - W and S for forward and back, respectively. Move the mouse for turning.

C is for close camera view, F is for far. 

B is for bird's eye view(btw in bird's eye view you can't move, it'd be too easy...).

To change from bird's eye to normal just press F or C.

You can also use R to change the maze, anytime. 

How to run the app: './Labyrinth [size]'  

***Optimal size is 10-20*** i didnt limit the size bc is always nice to see a PC crash... Put 500+ i dare you!

GL!
