# RG105-labyrinth-escape


Labyrinth escape is a very simple game, just find the way out.

Controls are - W and S for forward and back, respectively. Move the mouse for turning.

C is for close camera view, F is for far. 

B is for bird's eye view(btw in bird's eye view you can't move, it'd be too easy...).

To change from bird's eye to normal just press F or C.

You can also use R to change the maze, anytime. P is for getting you back to starting position.

How to run the app: './Labyrinth [size]'  

***Optimal size is 10-20!*** I didnt limit the size bc is always nice to see a PC crash... Put 500+ I dare you!

GL!

***Oh yeah, one more thing***... See, the walls have this tendency to swallow up people. Not because I'm a lousy programmer, but 'cause they are ***evil***, and you don't know how to avoid them! So anyways, if you ever get stuck just press P to get you back at start...or just press R like, 17 times, that should work.
